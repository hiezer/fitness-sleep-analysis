## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between daily physical activity and sleep patterns using FitBit fitness tracker data. **As a psychologist and data scientist**, I examine how behavioral patterns can inform personalized health interventions.

> 🔍 **Research Question**: "Is there a significant correlation between daily step count and sleep duration in adult users, and what psychological factors might explain this relationship?"

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Correlation analysis between fitness metrics and sleep
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs
- **Statistical Testing**: Hypothesis testing with p-values
- **Behavioral Insights**: Psychological interpretation of findings

## 📈 Preliminary Findings

| Metric | Value | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Correlation Coefficient | r = 0.42 | Moderate positive |
| P-value | p < 0.01 | Statistically significant |
| Sample Size | n = 30 users | 30 days tracking |
